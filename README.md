It is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that belongs to the family of actor-critic algorithms. The goal of the SAC algorithm is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) while taking into account the uncertainty of the value function.

One of the main advantages of SAC is that it can handle continuous action spaces, which makes it well-suited for a electric motor.

It was made during my work as Research Assistance with professor Ton Duc Do and Darkhan Zholtayev
